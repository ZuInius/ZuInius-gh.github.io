    <h2>The Origins of the Olympic Games</h2>
    <p>
    The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece around 776 BCE in Olympia, where athletes competed to honor Zeus. 
    These ancient Games were held every four years and continued for nearly 12 centuries.  
    In 1896, the Olympic Games were revived in modern form by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, leading to what we now know as the modern Olympic Games ‚Äî a celebration of international unity and athletic excellence.
    </p>

    <h2>Ancient vs Modern Olympics: Clearing the Misconception</h2>
    <p>
    A common misconception is that the modern Olympic Games are a continuation of the ancient Games. 
    While inspired by the spirit and traditions of ancient Greece, the modern Olympics are a separate, newly established event that began in the late 19th century. 
    They differ in scope, purpose, and structure but share a legacy of celebrating human athleticism.

          The Ancient Olympic Games were religious festivals held in Olympia from 776 BCE. 
          Only free Greek men were allowed to compete in a limited number of events such as wrestling, chariot racing, footraces, and pankration ‚Äî a brutal mix of boxing and wrestling. 
          These Games were deeply tied to the worship of Zeus, and victorious athletes were seen as heroes, receiving olive wreaths instead of medals. 
          The events took place every four years and served as a unifying tradition for the many independent city-states of Greece, which often were in conflict with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inaugural edition of the Games in 776 BCE featured only a single event ‚Äî a short footrace known as the stadion. 
          Over time, more events were added, including the pentathlon and equestrian races, reflecting the Greeks' emphasis on physical strength, discipline, and military readiness. 
          The purpose of the Games extended beyond athletic competition; they were religious rituals meant to honor Zeus and were accompanied by sacrifices, processions, and cultural displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ancient Olympics came to an end in 393 CE when the Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned all pagan festivals as part of the Empire‚Äôs Christianization efforts. 
          With the decline of Greek city-states and the rise of Roman dominance, the original spirit of the Games faded. 
          The legacy of the ancient Games, however, endured in cultural memory, laying the foundation for the modern revival over a millennium later.

          The Modern Olympic Games began in 1896 in Athens, Greece, thanks to the efforts of French educator Pierre de Coubertin. 
          Inspired by the ideals of the ancient Greeks, he envisioned an international sporting event that could promote peace, education, and unity among nations. 
          The first edition featured athletes from 14 countries competing in 9 sports, and though modest in scale compared to today, it marked the beginning of a global tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the modern Olympics is to bring the world together through friendly athletic competition. 
          Unlike their ancient counterpart, the modern Games include both men and women, feature hundreds of events, and involve participants from over 200 nations. 
          Athletes now compete not only for personal glory but also as representatives of their countries, with gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded to top performers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coubertin revived the Olympics not to replicate ancient customs but to channel their spirit into a contemporary context focused on peace and youth development. 
          The Games evolved to include both Summer and Winter editions, and have introduced cultural and educational programs alongside sports. 
          Through global broadcasts and international cooperation, the Olympics have become more than just a sporting event ‚Äî they are a symbol of unity, resilience, and shared humanity.

  <h2>The Role of Sports in the Olympic Games</h2>
  <p>
    Sports lie at the heart of the Olympic Movement, showcasing the pinnacle of human physical achievement, discipline,
    and international camaraderie. Through competition, athletes push boundaries‚Äînot just of performance, but of unity.
    Every Olympic sport is backed by an international governing federation and honors the ideals of fair play, equality,
    and global peace.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sports-evolution">
  <h2>How Sports Are Added or Removed</h2>
  <p>
    Since the first modern Olympics in 1896, the Olympic programme has evolved constantly. Eligibility for inclusion
    is governed by the IOC and requires an international federation, global participation, and event-size
    Sport additions like skateboarding, surfing, and karate (Tokyo 2020) or breakdancing (Paris 2024 debut) are approved
    via IOC sessions. Sports can also be dropped or reinstated; for example, baseball and softball were removed in 2005
    but returned for 2020, while cricket and lacrosse are set to return in 2028.
